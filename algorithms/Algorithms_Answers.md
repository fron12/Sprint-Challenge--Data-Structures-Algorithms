Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a) For each value n, we do one operation, so input size and number of operations grow in direct proportion. O(n) Linear Time

b) 4 for loops for each number n. O(4n) Log-Linear Time 
Solution O(n^4)

c) Until bunnies is zero. O(c) Constant Time
Solution O(n)

II) Use a binary search to find where the egg won't break and where the egg will break.
